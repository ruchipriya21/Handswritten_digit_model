# Handswritten_digit_model
The Project, Handwrittn digit rocognition is ML model build using neural network. The model recognize the human handwritten digits from different
sources like images, papers, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9).

## Dataset used

The dataset used for training the model is MINIST database. MNIST contains a total of 70,000 handwritten
digit images (60,000 training set and 10,000 test set) in 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased.
